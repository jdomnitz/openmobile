A few quick bits of info to new developers with the project and anyone else compiling this source.

I. Selecting a Solution File:

While openMobile is designed to be used on all major platforms in a compile once-run everywhere form, not all plugins are guarenteed to work on all platforms.  To keep things easy, we have created solutions for the various platforms that have the typical plugin selection for that OS.

OpenMobile-Typical: The most common set of plugins used on windows (doesn't require any specific hardware or software)
OpenMobile-Linux: The linux equivalent of OpenMobile-Typical.
OpenMobile-OSX: The OSX equivalent of OpenMobile-Typical
OpenMobile-Full: This is designed as a test build solution not for actual use.  This builds every plugin to ensure core changes do not break anything.

II. Licensing:
Unless stated otherwise, all source code contained in this repository is copyright GPLv3 OpenMobile and its contributors.  Even in cases where code may get commited that does not contain any license information, the previous statement remains true.
